Tk-FileEntry
============

This Perl/Tk widget provides an Entry widget with a button. Clicking
the button will open a choose file dialog. The path of the chosen file
will be inserted into the Entry widget.

This is useful if you want to provide a convenient way to select a
file path. Otherwise, you would have to code this feature over and
over again.

You can read a nicely formatted version of the documentation for
